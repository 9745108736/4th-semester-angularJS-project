    Kudumbashree is formally registered as the "State Poverty Eradication Mission" (SPEM), a society registered under the 
    Travancore Kochi Literary, Scientific and Charitable Societies Act 1955. It has a governing body chaired by the State Minister of LSG. There is a state mission with a field officer in each district. This official structure supports and facilitates the activities of the community network across the state. <!-- </p><p class="txtjusdtfy"> -->
    Kudumbashree differs from conventional programmes in that it perceives poverty not just as the deprivation of money, but also as the deprivation of basic rights. The poor need to find a collective voice to help claim these rights. The grassroots of Kudumbashree are Neighbourhood Groups (NHG in short) that send representatives to the ward level Area Development Societies (ADS). The ADS sends its representatives to the Community Development Society (CDS), which completes the unique three-tier structure of Kudumbashree. Today, there are 2.58 lakhs NHGs, over 19,700 ADSs and 1072 CDSs in Kudumbashree. It is this network that brings women to the Grama Sabhas and helps them bring the needs of the poor to the attention of the local governments. The Community Development Societies are also very active in Government programmes and play significant roles in development activities ranging from socio-economic surveys and enterprise development to community management and social audit.

    Though its efforts to engage women in civil society in development issues and opportunities, Kudumbashree in association with the local self government of Kerala is charting out new meaning and  

    possibilities for local economic development and citizen centric governance.

		<h2>History Of Kudumbashree</h2>
		<p class="txtjusdtfy">Various forms of microfinance practices have been in existence in Kerala from early days. When the concept of Self Help Group was introduced in Kerala in the 1980s, it was quick to gather momentum. In the early nineties a community led poverty identification format was developed as part of the Alappuzha UBSP Programme. By this time the NABARD promoted SHG, linkage banking programme had established itself as a viable microfinance model. In 1994, the CBNP project of Malappuram tried to assimilate these experiences and develop a women based community structure for service delivery of government programmes. The 73rd & 74th constitutional amendments strengthened PRIs and ULBs. Shortly afterwards, the People's Plan Campaign for decentralised Governance created strong local self governments (Panchayaths and Municipalities) in the State. Kudumbashree was launched in 1998 as a community network that would work in tandem with local self governments for poverty eradication and women empowerment.</p>
